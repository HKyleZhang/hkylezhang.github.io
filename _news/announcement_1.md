On this very day, I managed to defend my doctoral thesis "Genomic studies of sex differences: on mutations, recombination and sexual dimorphism in songbirds" (<a href="https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/135159563/Thesis_Hongkai_Zhang_without_papers.pdf">link to download</a>) in Department of Biology, Lund University. And it was a great honour to have Dr. Susan Johnston from the University of Edinburgh to be my opponent.
